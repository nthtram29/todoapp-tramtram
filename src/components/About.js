        <p> Todolist is a list of tasks that need to be completed in a day/week/monthâ€¦ arranged in order of priority from very important to unimportant. In other words, Todolist is like a plan outlined to achieve your desired goal. When you have a clear To-Do list, you will focus on performing tasks and avoid wasting time on distractions around, meeting the scheduled schedule.</p>

      <p> You can use our website to create your own to-do list. When you finish a task, you just need to tick the box "completed" and then you can safely continue to maintain the rest. You can also edit or delete the added work.
      Hopefully, our todoapp will help you define clear tasks, help you manage your work scientifically, arrange priorities, deadlines... All will create a system complete and you just need to look at it to perform the fastest, have good control over the task to be done and easily edit it so that it still ensures optimal use of time. From there, the job is completed in the best way without worrying about delay.
